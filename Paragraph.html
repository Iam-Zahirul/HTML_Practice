    <h1 align="center"><q>Dhaka is at the top of air pollution in the world</q></h1>
    <p align="justify">
        Nirmal Chandra Das has been suffering from cold for almost three months. He repaired the wheels of vehicles on
        the Kanchan Bridge section of the 300-foot road in Purbachal of the capital. The 12 km long road under
        construction is like a state of dust.
        One afternoon in the middle of this month, Nirmal was seen in the dust. In the first light of his speech, he
        said, Poor people; I need to go with poy-pulapain. For this reason, Thahi is in the dust. '
        Like Nirmal, many people of the capital are now in a dusty situation. According to a study by Dhaka University,
        dust contributes about 6 percent to Dhaka's air pollution. The study was led in 2003 by Abdus Salam, a professor
        in the university's chemistry department. Recently, he said in the first light, at present air pollution is
        associated with dust, car and industrial smoke. At present the amount of dust in the air has increased more than
        before. He added, 'Before there were not so many mega projects and cars. Besides, new sources of dust have been
        created as the reservoirs in Dhaka and surrounding areas have been filled up. '
        Meanwhile, Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, was at the top among the cities of the world in terms of air
        pollution around 11 am on Friday. At 10:06 pm, the position of Dhaka was the same. However, there is some change
        in this position throughout the day. The information about Dhaka's air pollution has been obtained from IQ Air,
        a Switzerland-based website that monitors global air quality.

        As a tropical country, Bangladesh has a lot of dust. For the next few years, dust pollution increased
        uncontrollably in the open environment. These include large projects such as the Metrorail, some areas such as
        Purbachal City and Bochilla, and numerous small housing projects. Added some ditches like Mohammadpur
        embankment. Apart from these places, dust is also seen in Gabtali, Jatrabari, Purbachal, Keraniganj, Tongi and
        some other areas at the entrance of the capital.
        <br>
        Even in this situation, the implementation of the guidelines for prevention of air pollution of the Ministry of
        Environment was not seen last year. The guidelines cover construction materials during road construction, use
        advanced technology such as mini asphalt plants without sprinkling sand on bitumen, cover roadside soil with
        concrete or grass, use vacuum sweeping trucks instead of road sweepers, spray water at least twice on major
        roads. The initiative was not noticed.

    <h2 align="center"><q>Announcement of movement till the demand is realized in Shahjalal University</q></h2>
    <p>
        Even on the third day of the hunger strike started by a section of agitating students at Shahjalal University of
        Science and Technology (SHUST) in Sylhet, no logical solution has been found regarding the demand for
        resignation of Vice Chancellor Farid Uddin Ahmed. However, the students who are on hunger strike are getting
        sick one by one due to the extreme cold. The angry students announced on Friday that they would not return home
        until their demands were met.

        Meanwhile, Education Minister Dipu Moni has sent Awami League Central Organizing Secretary Shafiul Alam
        Chowdhury to the agitating students. On Friday, from one to three o'clock in the afternoon, he had three
        meetings with the students and one meeting with the Vice-Chancellor.


        The agitating students on Tuesday night demanded the resignation of Vice Chancellor Farid Uddin by 12 noon on
        Wednesday. As he did not resign, 24 students started a hunger strike in front of his residence that afternoon.
        The hunger strike was going on till the writing of this report on Friday evening. However, 14 people have been
        admitted to different hospitals due to illness. Apart from this, the father of a student who went on hunger
        strike went home last Thursday morning due to a heart attack.

        The agitating students said that none of the students undergoing treatment at the hospital broke their fast.
        They want to join the program again. In all, 9 people are still on hunger strike. However, their physical
        condition is deteriorating. They are suffering from fever and low blood pressure. Doctors have pushed saline in
        everyone's body. However, they will continue the hunger strike.
